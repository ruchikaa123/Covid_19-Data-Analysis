# Covid_19-Data-Analysis
__Identifying the No. of beds, Primary/S/T cases, Hotspots,, Impact of social Distancing__

The dataset can also be taken from https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india.

# Problem 

__Using the above datasets, make a report on the following points: Note: Any assumptions made should be properly mentioned in the report__
1. Which age group is the most infected?
2. Plot graphs of the cases observed, recovered, deaths per day country-wise and state-wise.
3. Identify the positive cases on a state level. Quantify the intensity of virus spread for each state.*
Intensity here means number of positive cases/population density.
4. List places in the country which are active hotspots/clusters as on 10.04.2020.* Hotspot is defined as an area in a city where 10 or more people have been tested positive.
5. Which states have the maximum change (consider increase and decrease separately) in number of hotspots on weekly basis from 20.03.2020 to 10.04.2020 (3 weeks). 6. For the given data, identify cases with international travel history (primary case), personal contact with primary case (secondary case). Cases which do not fall in the primary and secondary fall into tertiary case. Quantify them based on the percentage for the top 5 states with maximum cases till 10.04.2020.*
7. Find out the number of additional labs needed from the current existing labs (assume 100 tests per day per lab) with an increase rate of 10% cases per day from 11.04.2020 - 20.04.2020. List out any further assumptions considered. 8. Plot the number of cases starting from 1st March - 10th April. Based on this plot can you comment on the popular notion of ‘flattening the curve’.*
9. As we know, social distancing is the best option to avoid the spread. Based on the time series data (covid_19_india.csv), can you suggest how successful the 21 days lockdown has been?
*Visualization required

# Output
1. The age group of 20-29 is most infected. As observed in AgeGroupDetails.csv, this age group has the highest percentage of cases which is 0.248600 with Total Cases being 172 nos.
